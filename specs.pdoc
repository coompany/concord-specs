# Network
Based on Kademlia [@maymounkov2002kademlia] and its extension S/Kademlia [@baumgart2007s]. Each node is identified by a `nodeId` which is computed using a crypto puzzle. The puzzle generates also a key pair that
is used to sign and verify integrity of messages.


# Voting Protocol
The goal of this protocol is to allow anyone to create a poll and collect opinions on it. Each node is itself a voter and
everyone is free to participate in the voting process.
